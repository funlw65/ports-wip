Ophis is a cross-assembler for the 65xx series of chips. It supports
the stock 6502 opcodes, the 65c02 extensions, experimental support for
the 4502/4510 used in the Commodore 65 prototypes, and syntax for the
"undocumented opcodes" in the 6510 chip used on the Commodore
64. (Syntax for these opcodes matches those given in the VICE team's
documentation.)
