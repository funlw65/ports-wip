VICE is a program that runs on a Unix, MS-DOS, Win32, OS/2, Acorn RISC
OS, BeOS, QNX 4.x, QNX 6.x, Amiga, GP2X, Dingoo, Syllable or Mac OS X
machine and executes programs intended for the old 8-bit
computers. The current version emulates the C64, the C64DTV, the C128,
the VIC20, almost all PET models, the PLUS4 and the CBM-II (aka C610).
